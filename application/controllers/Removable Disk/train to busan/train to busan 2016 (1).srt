1
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,100
What is it now this early?
You're going to bury my livestock again?

2
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:43,343
No, Its just a normal inspection,
there's just a small leak at the site.

3
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,063
Go ahead, move along.

4
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:53,595
Why are you doing this to me?
Just like the last time?

5
00:01:55,421 --> 00:02:00,501
I promise, not this time, now move along.

6
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,581
Go.

7
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:14,179
What a really bad day, rough morning,
what...

8
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:21,287
Come on.

9
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:35,480
Oh come on!

10
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:47,349
What a really rough day for me.

11
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:43,150
Madame,

12
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:47,829
statistical data companies we showed
abnormal in stock market.

13
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,429
Please do not liquidate your investment now.

14
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,142
The market will fall once
you've taken your investment...

15
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:56,185
Yes, I understand.

16
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:03,738
No, it is not.
I will do it as soon as possible.

17
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:05,338
Yes.

18
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,502
It will be run according to your wishes.

19
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:10,268
Please take care!

20
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,355
Come into my office.

21
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:46,634
What is the matter?

22
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,118
Sell all of our assets in the stock market.

23
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,807
Selling it all?

24
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:51,374
Yes.

25
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:56,466
Isn't it too risky to do that?
Still we could maintain our first asset.

26
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:58,117
And wait if something better...

27
00:04:58,118 --> 00:04:58,768
Mr. Kim.

28
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:00,418
Yes.

29
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,683
Just do what I tell you to do.

30
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:07,579
We must be watchful of the
possibility that happen.

31
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:09,715
Okay.

32
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:13,738
Wait a minute Mr.Kim.

33
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:20,110
What's the popular gift for kids nowadays?

34
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:29,556
Forget it. You really can't be a good dad to Su-an.
You didn't even attend her recital.

35
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:32,326
I did not forget that.
There's a lot of work here.

36
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,939
She can stay here in Seoul with me.

37
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:38,003
Just send her here in Busan!
You've already broke your promises!

38
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,986
How many times have you told her that you'll come.

39
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:43,794
Can't you keep it just this once?

40
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:45,776
Yes I promise we all go.

41
00:05:46,741 --> 00:05:49,029
You really don't keep your words.

42
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,689
I'm keeping my words...

43
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:52,658
You just have to keep your words.

44
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:54,812
Children are tired of always
with the promise…

45
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:56,251
Never mind, I'll talk to you...

46
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,082
You know that its her birthday tomorrow right?

47
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:00,567
I know!

48
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,002
Oh, you're here now.

49
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,340
Thank you...

50
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:32,389
Where is she?

51
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:37,213
She was playing in her room...

52
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,250
When will we see each other?

53
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:45,415
Why? Mom did not talk to dad huh?

54
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:52,880
I'm gonna hang the phone now, he's here.

55
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:06,590
It's okay you can talk to her.

56
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:07,962
I already hung-up.

57
00:07:33,391 --> 00:07:34,137
Here.

58
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,053
You thought I forgot?
Happy birthday.

59
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:45,027
Well? Open it.

60
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,190
Why? You don't like it?

61
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:21,127
Last year on children's day too.

62
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Well, tell me what you want.

63
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:32,696
Busan.

64
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:36,068
I want to go to mom at Busan.

65
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:36,469
Tomorrow...

66
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,655
Yeah, just wait.

67
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,316
We definitely go there after
father finished...

68
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:42,170
No.

69
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:43,325
Tomorrow.

70
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:46,248
Dad always say we'll go next time.

71
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:48,797
Anyway, tomorrow we have to go...

72
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,506
You don't have to come with me.

73
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:53,983
Grant my wish for once.

74
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:02,645
Is there a lot of work?

75
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,973
Yes there is.

76
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:09,941
Are you going to Busan tomorrow?

77
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,928
Yes.

78
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:18,082
You did good. Try talking with your
wife when you arrive there.

79
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:22,287
It's not good if you just break-up like that.

80
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:24,816
You two should re-unite again.

81
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:30,117
There is nothing wrong
you are together again...

82
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,455
Try it this time so that
you can come back again...

83
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,456
Mother...

84
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,515
I do not want to talk about it...

85
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,428
Let it be the past...

86
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,476
OK...

87
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,776
Do not be too busy with work...

88
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:53,679
Sometimes you should not always focus
on work. Su-an is growing up.

89
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:55,865
She also needs you.

90
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,978
Take care of your family, especially Su-an.

91
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,985
It's okay.

92
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,460
It's okay, continue singing...

93
00:10:48,461 --> 00:10:51,361
Applause for Soo-an...

94
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:07,966
Yeah... ma...

95
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:10,957
No...

96
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:12,841
I'm with Dad.

97
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:19,255
Yeah, I'll see you there...

98
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:38,067
You thought father did not
know that you didn't finished the song.

99
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:41,258
How did you know?
You weren't there.

100
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:46,806
Father always know what you've been doing.

101
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:51,925
You got nervous right?
Am I right?

102
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,687
Yes.

103
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,505
Why did you do that? You'll look like
a fool if you don't finish it.

104
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:00,202
When you started something.

105
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,203
You should finish it no matter what.

106
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,700
You should know that…

107
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:18,458
Ah… that was close.

108
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,682
What's going on?

109
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,871
Su-an, are you okay?
You're surprised right?

110
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,668
It surprised me. It suddenly came out.

111
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,680
It looks like a big fire.

112
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:14,000
All departing passengers, kindly board the train now
as this train is now ready to depart for Busan.

113
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,806
Excuse me, where is the south station?

114
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:18,168
South station, you need to go that way...

115
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:48,003
-Kyo-shi! Kyo-shi!
- Yes?

116
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:49,185
Your scarf.

117
00:13:56,776 --> 00:13:59,998
Please rest during this trip.

118
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
Good.

119
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:07,375
Wow, Jihee is here.

120
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:13,411
What do you mean, I'm coming with you.

121
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:14,751
I'm your cheerleader.

122
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,570
-How are you all ?
-Good...

123
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:22,208
Finally... also fresh eyes...

124
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:26,214
Finally...

125
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:31,295
Hey, go find another seat okay.

126
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:33,102
Stingy you did not want to share...

127
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:37,148
Hey, if your’re thankful to see me,
Just say "Thank you".

128
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:39,703
Even the "tools" you also right for you...

129
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:42,914
She's right...

130
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:50,002
Accept her. Accept her.
Accept her. Accept her.

131
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:53,968
Here, eat this.

132
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:57,516
Aigoo...

133
00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:01,222
Where did you get that egg.
Eat it yourself.

134
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,195
-Eat this.
-No, I don't like.

135
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:08,614
-Chief, Are you already on board?
-Yes, but why?

136
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:13,614
There are problems in the office...
let us take care of it.

137
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,002
Really?

138
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:19,019
We'll discuss it after I get back.

139
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,718
I'll be there after lunch.

140
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,419
-See you later...
-Good.

141
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:30,419
I'm so sorry… I’m so sorry...

142
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:34,626
Please forgive me.

143
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:38,347
I'm so sorry.

144
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:49,344
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

145
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:52,031
-Are you the one in-charge?
-Yes.

146
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:54,894
I’ve seen a suspicious passenger.

147
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:58,518
-Where is the passenger?
-Inside the lavatory,

148
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,357
-It's been a while since then.
-Really? Lets see..

149
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:08,553
Ahh. I apologize sir.
I will check on it.

150
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,005
Passenger?

151
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:22,526
Passenger?

152
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,113
Passenger?

153
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,931
Everyone is dead.

154
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:38,932
Mister.

155
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:41,146
Mister.

156
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,110
-I'm sorry, but may I see your ticket?
-Everyone is dead…

157
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:52,932
Mister, if you don't have a ticket
we need to drop you off on the next station.

158
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:56,552
Everyone is dead

159
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,693
Hey kid, if you don't study well,
you'll end up like him.

160
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:16,871
My mother told me not to say
those kinds of words.

161
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:19,520
Well, it looks like your mother didn't study well
<i>Passengers please don't stay here</i>

162
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:01,189
In a hurry?

163
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:06,500
We'll, you'll need to find another place
because it will take a while.

164
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:09,356
You could use the other comfort room.
Go there.

165
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,301
It will really take a while.

166
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,606
Baby? How are you doing down there?

167
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:22,982
Ahhh.. sorry, go ahead,
take your time... take your time...

168
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:26,065
Go there, go there...

169
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:27,615
She's gone, she's gone...

170
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:28,942
relax... relax...

171
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:41,468
Miss? Miss, are you okay?

172
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,007
Miss? What to do..

173
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:49,956
Chief!

174
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,445
-Hello?
-Yes, Kim?

175
00:20:04,446 --> 00:20:07,397
It's more serious than we anticipated.

176
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:10,709
It's not just an overnight Ansan incident.

177
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,217
I don't know whats happening,
but it's not a simple strike.

178
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:14,618
Military Deployed to Control Riots

179
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,421
They say it's nationwide

180
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:17,848
-What about breathing?
-Hello?

181
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:22,727
But her seizure is uncontrollable!

182
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:25,326
Sir, what should we do?

183
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:26,827
I'll call you back.

184
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,153
Indiscriminate Violence at Riot

185
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,756
Oh no, they'll get hurt.
That's terrible.

186
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:45,142
People nowadays will riot over anything.

187
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,062
In the old days, they'd be re-educated.

188
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:51,144
You mustn't say that.

189
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:52,645
Look, look.

190
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:56,177
What's up with them?

191
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,459
Miss?

192
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:01,217
What do I do..

193
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:07,053
Chief? Chief where are you?

194
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:11,554
I don't believe this...

195
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:23,002
Chief?

196
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,343
Min Ji? Min Ji?

197
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,820
What is that? What is happening.

198
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,194
What is this?

199
00:22:30,497 --> 00:22:33,935
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

200
00:22:57,156 --> 00:22:59,284
Hurry! Everyone Run!

201
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,129
Stand up!

202
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:07,810
Conductor!
We have a situation here!

203
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:22,174
Run! Run!

204
00:23:42,735 --> 00:23:46,735
-Oh my God!
-What in the hell!?

205
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:58,146
Get away! Just go!

206
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:06,867
Get out of here! Head for the back!

207
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,578
Get up! Hurry!

208
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:31,689
Daddy!

209
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:15,029
Baby?

210
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:19,029
Sang-hwa! So damn loud!

211
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,300
Sorry, the thing is...

212
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:22,488
Get off me!

213
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,059
You idiot! Go help her!

214
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:39,028
Hey!

215
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,879
What's with you?!

216
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:45,832
Have you gone mad?!

217
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:01,835
Baby?

218
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Sung-Kyung!

219
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:08,360
You can run, right?

220
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,040
Get Away!

221
00:26:40,753 --> 00:26:43,028
Close the door! The door!

222
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:44,028
Shut the door!

223
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:45,029
Quick!

224
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,059
Quick!

225
00:26:48,555 --> 00:26:49,555
Shut it!

226
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,519
Shut it now!

227
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,027
Just shut it!!!

228
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:05,141
I know her!

229
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:19,281
Where's the lock?

230
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,569
Buddy, how do I lock this?

231
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:27,029
Do you hear me?

232
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:31,029
Let it go.

233
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:33,048
What?

234
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:38,934
I don't think they know how to open.

235
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:50,592
They attack because they see us.

236
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,250
What in the...

237
00:28:11,593 --> 00:28:12,593
What are they?

238
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,463
Su-an, you okay?

239
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:22,768
Hey buddy.

240
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:24,991
What is it?

241
00:28:26,717 --> 00:28:28,679
Don't you owe me an apology?

242
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:29,891
What do you mean?

243
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:32,127
Look at this chump.

244
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:35,431
You shut the door in our faces, asshole!

245
00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:38,432
You weren't the only ones in danger!

246
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,291
What a piece of work.

247
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:42,879
Come here.

248
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,522
I'll feed you to them.

249
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,881
Stop it!

250
00:28:46,222 --> 00:28:47,657
Everyone's just scared.

251
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:54,773
Attention please!

252
00:28:54,774 --> 00:29:00,506
Due to our current situation,
we wont be stopping in Cheonan,

253
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:08,599
For your safety, please stay in your seats.

254
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:11,111
Hello, anyone there?

255
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,585
Yes, go ahead.

256
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,513
Do you even know what's going on back here?

257
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:19,441
Why aren't you stopping at Cheonan?

258
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:20,786
We're aware, sir

259
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:24,017
This is the order from the control center.

260
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,590
Please be seated.

261
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:30,665
That's nonsense!
People are going rabid!

262
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:33,410
Stop in Cheonan, got it?!

263
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:35,696
Excuse me.

264
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:42,651
I'm really sorry but could she sit down?
She's pregnant.

265
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:43,652
Okay

266
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:45,799
Sit, sit.

267
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,033
Thank you.

268
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:51,354
Mom.

269
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:55,818
Are you on your way?

270
00:29:55,912 --> 00:29:57,914
Yes, we're en route.

271
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,755
Where are you? Why is it so loud?

272
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:05,141
What's happening you say?
Everyone's fighting.

273
00:30:05,364 --> 00:30:08,564
Are you and Su-an okay?

274
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:11,693
Why're you breathing like that, are you hurt?

275
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:15,864
Seok-woo, my baby.

276
00:30:15,865 --> 00:30:21,149
Please take care of Su-an...

277
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,875
Mom, you okay?

278
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:25,498
My dear Su-an...

279
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:34,402
I love her so much, but she only wants her mom...

280
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,262
That bitch!

281
00:30:47,943 --> 00:30:49,442
Mom?

282
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:52,733
Dad!

283
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:55,838
Dad!

284
00:30:58,134 --> 00:31:00,203
Is granny okay?

285
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:09,427
What the hell?

286
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,241
Sweetie, sit down.

287
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:00,571
My fellow citizens...

288
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:07,308
we're currently experiencing violent
riots in all major cities,

289
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:12,937
resulting in many civilian and police injuries.

290
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:17,579
Riots led to shutting down of various districts,

291
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,354
and the rioters have forcibly
attempted to destroy

292
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:26,061
or take government property.

293
00:32:26,803 --> 00:32:30,902
For this reason,
we're entering state of emergency,

294
00:32:30,903 --> 00:32:36,977
in order to control current situations.

295
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:46,308
Thanks to our government's rapid response,

296
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:49,624
various outbreaks are being contained.

297
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:59,124
Fellow citizens, please refrain from
reacting to baseless rumors,

298
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:05,150
and stay in the safety of your homes.

299
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:12,119
We must stay calm and trust the government,
in order to overcome such trying obstacle.

300
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,278
We believe that your safety is not in jeopardy.

301
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:32,029
Analyst Kim

302
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:41,582
Mommy's phone is off.

303
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:47,206
Those in the front, hurry up!

304
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:49,015
Su-an, sit over here.

305
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,936
Don't worry, i'll give her a call.

306
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:55,713
Jong-gil, come sit down.

307
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:59,638
-You're older, you sit down.
-I'm fine, take it.

308
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:01,399
Baby, let's go over there.

309
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:08,221
Ma'am, take my seat.

310
00:34:08,222 --> 00:34:11,196
-I'm okay.
-No, please sit.

311
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,535
Child, would you like one?

312
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:24,816
-Thank you!
-What a great kid.

313
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,254
-We both got seats.
-Keep walking.

314
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,009
Su-an, you didn't have to do that.

315
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:41,387
-Do what?
-Being good.

316
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:45,751
At a time like this,
only watch out for yourself.

317
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:48,428
Answer me.

318
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:57,337
Granny always had knee aches.

319
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,650
Sweetie...

320
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:12,133
May I have you attention please, our train
will conclude service at Daejeon station.

321
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:18,423
Military is deployed there,
and will secure our train,

322
00:35:18,424 --> 00:35:22,300
so once we arrive, please exit the train.

323
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:27,169
I repeat, DAEJEON STATION is our last stop.

324
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,772
Which cities can be entered?

325
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:33,020
Yeosu, Uljin, Busan.
What about Daejeon?

326
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:34,590
Excuse me, I need to use it.

327
00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:36,448
What about Daejeon?

328
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:37,757
Why not?!

329
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:43,141
Sweetie, stay put.

330
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,086
Hey, kiddo.

331
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:48,439
Yes?

332
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,860
Who is he? Your dad?

333
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:52,182
Yes.

334
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:54,142
-Real dad?
-Yes.

335
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,396
I wanna know.

336
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,638
What does he do?

337
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,925
He's a fund manager.

338
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:03,650
-Fund manager?
-Yes

339
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:05,046
He's a bloodsucker.

340
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,750
He leaches off others.

341
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:12,010
Don't say that in front of his child.

342
00:36:12,011 --> 00:36:13,211
It's okay.

343
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:17,290
That's what everyone thinks.

344
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:23,406
Want some?

345
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:26,708
It's what Sleepy eats.

346
00:36:28,035 --> 00:36:31,363
This is Sleepy. Say hello.

347
00:36:31,784 --> 00:36:34,295
Baby's name is Sleepy?

348
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,616
No, the foetus name.

349
00:36:35,934 --> 00:36:38,069
It's like a nickname,

350
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,933
he's daddy too lazy
to come up with a name yet.

351
00:36:44,573 --> 00:36:45,573
Touch her belly.

352
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,050
Right here.

353
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:49,478
Go on.

354
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,872
Felt it?

355
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,799
I made that.

356
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,973
-You idiot...
-But it's true, No?

357
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:22,953
-Mr. Suh, you called me at a bad time...
-Wait, Wait!

358
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:25,114
Let me ask you something,

359
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,115
What?

360
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:29,210
I'm on KTX to Daejeon.

361
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:33,304
KTX? Right this minute?

362
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:34,991
Yes, I'm almost there,

363
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:39,451
Is it true military is deployed in Daejeon?

364
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,381
Yes, that's correct.

365
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,670
Is that so? It must be safe there.

366
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:50,581
Well... it's...

367
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:55,276
Min, it is safe, right?

368
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:00,489
Once you arrive, you'll be quarantined.

369
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:01,945
What?

370
00:38:05,548 --> 00:38:09,056
I'm with my daughter.

371
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:12,735
Can you help me and my daughter?

372
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,352
But the thing is...

373
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:19,035
I'll get you a real scoop, do me a favor.

374
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:24,903
Don't go to the main square,
come to the East one.

375
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:26,627
I'll let my men know.

376
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,738
Okay, thank you.
Thanks so much.

377
00:38:37,696 --> 00:38:45,697
All dead... all dead...

378
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:57,766
What's going on?

379
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:58,942
So quiet.

380
00:38:58,949 --> 00:38:59,949
Is it Daejeon?

381
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:07,221
There's nobody.

382
00:39:09,255 --> 00:39:11,255
Why isn't anyone here?

383
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:21,954
What's going on back there?

384
00:40:24,865 --> 00:40:29,324
This is that violent incident I told you about.

385
00:40:29,754 --> 00:40:31,192
-You’re the conductor?
-Yes.

386
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:33,773
How many can fit in the engine car?

387
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:36,077
We must uncouple it and go to Busan.

388
00:40:36,078 --> 00:40:37,516
-Uncouple?
-Yes!

389
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:39,342
-We can't!
-Why not?!

390
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,733
It can't be done here.

391
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:44,841
Then, where's the military?

392
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,842
Right...

393
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:48,033
I only received a report about it...

394
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,322
Where's my business card...

395
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:53,967
I'm COO of Stallion Express,

396
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:56,163
all routes into Daejeon are cut off.

397
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,117
Our busses are all rerouted.

398
00:40:58,118 --> 00:40:59,118
But what for?

399
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,728
The city's been quarantined!

400
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:03,870
They probably won't let us in.

401
00:41:03,871 --> 00:41:08,945
But Busan is still open, let's go there!

402
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:11,028
Wait, if that's true...

403
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:14,054
-We just take others.
-Take who?!

404
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,568
Let's check the station first.

405
00:41:16,009 --> 00:41:17,009
Hey!

406
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:22,200
Dammit!

407
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:05,611
Don't mind them.

408
00:42:11,715 --> 00:42:14,217
-Come on sweetie.
-Where are we going?

409
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,629
We're going this way.

410
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,336
-Just us?
-Yes, let's go.

411
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,760
What is it?

412
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:30,736
I'm going this way too.

413
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:34,168
Main square is that way,
just follow other people.

414
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:36,114
I'm gonna come with you.

415
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,752
I heard your phone call.

416
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:41,311
About pulling you two out.

417
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:45,490
I know others will be quarantined.

418
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:48,962
It's not true, Su-an.

419
00:42:48,963 --> 00:42:50,624
I'll go tell the others.

420
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:54,431
-You don't have to.
-Of course I do!

421
00:42:54,432 --> 00:42:57,136
Forget them!
We're all on our own!

422
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:02,463
You only care about yourself.

423
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:08,984
That's why mommy left.

424
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:28,659
Sweetie...

425
00:43:31,398 --> 00:43:33,440
Here! Over here!

426
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:34,920
Please help!

427
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:38,988
Sweetie, stay right here.

428
00:43:59,868 --> 00:44:01,472
Goddamit!

429
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:04,147
Hold on!

430
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:17,779
Go back up! Go! Go!

431
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:35,977
Mr. Min.

432
00:44:35,978 --> 00:44:37,840
-Mr. Suh!
-Is everything okay there?

433
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,196
I can't contact my men!

434
00:44:40,197 --> 00:44:41,197
Hello?

435
00:44:42,574 --> 00:44:43,574
Help me...

436
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,368
Come on! Hurry!

437
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:42,449
Hurry up! Quick!

438
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,270
Take this!

439
00:46:02,152 --> 00:46:03,904
Run! Come on!

440
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:10,784
Asshole! Come on!

441
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:20,017
Faster!

442
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:23,668
Hold them off!

443
00:46:56,672 --> 00:47:00,172
-Over here! Run!
-This way! Hurry!

444
00:47:01,962 --> 00:47:02,962
Here!

445
00:47:06,776 --> 00:47:08,176
This way!

446
00:47:08,511 --> 00:47:09,511
Come on!

447
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:10,864
Hurry!

448
00:47:11,573 --> 00:47:13,285
Why aren't we leaving yet?!

449
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,856
There are still more people!

450
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:17,099
Hurry up!

451
00:47:18,021 --> 00:47:19,683
Come this way!

452
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:21,788
Hurry!

453
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:23,100
Faster! Here!

454
00:47:36,712 --> 00:47:37,941
Granny!

455
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:40,680
Please get up!

456
00:47:49,915 --> 00:47:51,494
No, stop!

457
00:47:52,474 --> 00:47:53,925
My sister!

458
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,926
Hop on!

459
00:48:22,478 --> 00:48:23,478
Me too!

460
00:48:24,013 --> 00:48:25,013
Let me in!

461
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:27,590
Please!

462
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,237
How much longer?
We have to leave!

463
00:48:48,248 --> 00:48:50,926
No! My friends aren't here yet!

464
00:48:51,549 --> 00:48:53,921
Those onboard must survive!

465
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:55,352
Ain't I right?

466
00:49:01,896 --> 00:49:02,896
Conductor.

467
00:49:03,951 --> 00:49:06,921
Please... depart.

468
00:49:26,983 --> 00:49:28,547
Run! Let's go!

469
00:49:44,493 --> 00:49:45,793
Look, the train!

470
00:49:45,964 --> 00:49:47,335
Run faster!

471
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:08,391
Snap out of it, idiot!

472
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,310
Watch out!

473
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:04,611
Control, 101 could not dock
at Daejeon due to outbreak.

474
00:51:04,612 --> 00:51:07,808
Advise which station is available to dock, over.

475
00:51:08,025 --> 00:51:12,972
101, due to unstable comm,
it is difficult to advise.

476
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:18,985
Control, is 101 clear to reach Busan?
Over.

477
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:24,273
101, we'll clear your route to Busan.

478
00:51:24,274 --> 00:51:25,349
Control center, out.

479
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:29,553
Advise when you make contact with Busan.

480
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,480
101, out.

481
00:52:47,257 --> 00:52:50,016
Attention everyone.

482
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:55,570
For those safety of those on board,
we won't be making any stops,

483
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:57,738
and head straight for Busan.

484
00:52:58,877 --> 00:53:00,979
Conductor, can you hear me?

485
00:53:01,674 --> 00:53:02,674
Go ahead.

486
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:05,277
Were you able to contact Busan?

487
00:53:05,278 --> 00:53:08,496
No, the communication is erratic.

488
00:53:09,536 --> 00:53:11,821
Full speed, no matter what!

489
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:14,496
Or we won't get in, understand?

490
00:53:21,816 --> 00:53:23,933
Youngguk, where are you?

491
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:29,510
I thought you were dead!

492
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:31,134
I'm sorry!

493
00:53:33,094 --> 00:53:35,202
No one else made it!

494
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:37,682
I'm sorry.

495
00:53:48,655 --> 00:53:50,684
-Baby?
-Mister!

496
00:53:52,075 --> 00:53:54,809
Huh? Why are you answering?
Where are you?

497
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,877
We're in the train washroom!

498
00:53:56,878 --> 00:53:59,878
Washroom? Which car?

499
00:53:59,901 --> 00:54:02,358
Well... it's...

500
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:04,088
Car 13!

501
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:06,702
-Get your ass over here!
-Baby

502
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,035
Was that my kid?
Is she okay?

503
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:14,128
Washroom in car 13.

504
00:54:29,317 --> 00:54:30,714
Gonna pass through?

505
00:54:32,621 --> 00:54:36,888
Let's say you got through and rescue them,
how will you come back?

506
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:42,569
In car 15,

507
00:54:44,082 --> 00:54:45,815
People are gathered there.

508
00:55:11,653 --> 00:55:13,056
Only 4 cars away.

509
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:16,061
I'll lead...

510
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:19,122
you in the middle...

511
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:21,647
and you in the back.

512
00:55:24,578 --> 00:55:27,246
Block anyone attacking from the rear.

513
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,522
I heard you're a fund manager.

514
00:55:44,034 --> 00:55:46,220
Then you're an expert...

515
00:55:46,648 --> 00:55:49,039
at leaving useless people behind.

516
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:57,641
Wait till we exit the tunnel.

517
00:56:12,377 --> 00:56:13,518
Let's go.

518
00:57:24,907 --> 00:57:25,907
Come on!

519
00:57:28,621 --> 00:57:29,621
Let's go!

520
00:57:46,437 --> 00:57:47,717
Move.

521
00:59:30,906 --> 00:59:31,906
Out of the way.

522
00:59:36,902 --> 00:59:39,948
They stopped once we
entered the tunnel, right?

523
00:59:40,574 --> 00:59:42,084
Probably because of darkness.

524
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:44,471
Yeah, I think so too.

525
00:59:46,845 --> 00:59:49,491
There are even more here.

526
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:51,648
What do we do now?

527
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,487
There's no way around it.

528
00:59:54,872 --> 00:59:55,872
Let's go.

529
01:02:06,817 --> 01:02:08,417
Get that out of my face.

530
01:02:10,738 --> 01:02:11,738
Yo, douche.

531
01:02:13,494 --> 01:02:16,995
Felt good to see your kid, thanks to me?

532
01:02:16,996 --> 01:02:19,438
Are you grateful or what?

533
01:02:19,575 --> 01:02:21,847
Why is your ringtone so tacky?

534
01:02:23,255 --> 01:02:24,655
What's wrong with it?

535
01:02:26,779 --> 01:02:29,931
How do I change it?

536
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:35,091
Am I funny? You little rat?

537
01:02:35,365 --> 01:02:36,499
How tall are you?

538
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,125
181 cm.

539
01:02:39,133 --> 01:02:41,754
10 km away, at 300 km/h...

540
01:02:41,755 --> 01:02:42,755
What?

541
01:02:45,899 --> 01:02:49,217
2 minutes, upcoming tunnel will give us 2 minutes.

542
01:02:49,218 --> 01:02:52,181
-Can we do it?
-We gotta.

543
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:58,637
If we miss this one,
there's another in 3 km...

544
01:02:58,638 --> 01:03:01,721
I bet you never get to
play with your daughter.

545
01:03:03,066 --> 01:03:06,127
When she gets older,

546
01:03:06,128 --> 01:03:10,030
she'll understand why you work so hard.

547
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:15,251
Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,

548
01:03:15,252 --> 01:03:18,098
but it's all about sacrifice, right?

549
01:03:21,104 --> 01:03:24,604
What's with the look?
Did I sound cool?

550
01:03:32,826 --> 01:03:35,611
People rescued. Heading over now.

551
01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:37,806
My friend's coming here!

552
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:40,220
What did you say?

553
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:43,580
My friend from another car is coming over.

554
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:45,802
-Who's coming?
-My friend!

555
01:03:45,891 --> 01:03:49,617
He was in car 9, and he rescued some people.

556
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:50,827
Rescued?

557
01:03:52,622 --> 01:03:57,658
From there to here,
passing through those monsters?

558
01:03:58,288 --> 01:03:59,688
Without any injuries?

559
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:03,121
You sure they're not infected?

560
01:04:04,059 --> 01:04:07,479
Are you damn sure?!

561
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,118
What do you mean?

562
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:13,007
Look, look at them.

563
01:04:13,512 --> 01:04:15,315
At a moment like this,

564
01:04:15,316 --> 01:04:20,177
no one knows what happened to their families.

565
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:25,568
We don't even know if your
damn friends are infected!

566
01:04:25,803 --> 01:04:28,372
But allow them in here?!

567
01:04:33,158 --> 01:04:36,001
I don't believe this.

568
01:04:44,387 --> 01:04:45,828
Sir...

569
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:50,335
Please say something.

570
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,636
They'll be here soon.

571
01:04:55,035 --> 01:04:56,108
Sir!

572
01:08:44,764 --> 01:08:45,764
Get over here.

573
01:08:54,906 --> 01:08:55,906
One!

574
01:08:58,256 --> 01:08:59,256
Two!

575
01:09:06,053 --> 01:09:07,686
Run!

576
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:21,539
Jin-hee! Jin-hee!

577
01:09:25,063 --> 01:09:26,762
Hurry the hell up!

578
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,400
Open up!

579
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,178
Hey! Open this door!

580
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:43,619
Jin-hee!

581
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:44,824
Open this door!

582
01:10:00,781 --> 01:10:04,259
-Open up!
-Jin-hee! Jin-hee!

583
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:16,349
Open it now!

584
01:10:16,823 --> 01:10:18,135
It wont budge!

585
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:19,585
It can't open it!

586
01:10:19,671 --> 01:10:20,979
Smash it!

587
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:22,951
Stand back!

588
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,870
Hurry up!

589
01:11:00,858 --> 01:11:02,058
You stupid idiots!

590
01:11:16,052 --> 01:11:17,052
Come on!

591
01:11:28,778 --> 01:11:29,778
In-gil!

592
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:36,046
Young-guk!

593
01:11:39,902 --> 01:11:41,114
Stand back!

594
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:42,630
Young-guk!

595
01:12:16,672 --> 01:12:18,386
Stay away!

596
01:12:24,839 --> 01:12:30,802
Stay back, baby. Please go!

597
01:12:35,246 --> 01:12:37,116
Buddy, hey!

598
01:12:37,468 --> 01:12:40,665
Take her and leave.

599
01:12:41,452 --> 01:12:43,225
You have to go!

600
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:46,357
I said go, douche!

601
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:50,081
I'm getting tired, please go.

602
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:57,926
Take care of her, okay?

603
01:12:58,099 --> 01:13:02,455
I'll hold them off, just go!

604
01:13:12,386 --> 01:13:14,886
I'm sorry...

605
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:27,090
We have to go, let's go!

606
01:13:29,111 --> 01:13:30,544
Yoon Su-yun!

607
01:13:32,763 --> 01:13:34,691
Our baby's name!

608
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:37,861
Got it?

609
01:15:36,969 --> 01:15:38,862
Why did you do it?!

610
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,495
You bastard!

611
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:45,842
We could've save them!

612
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:49,059
Why?!

613
01:15:50,487 --> 01:15:52,312
He's infected!

614
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,464
He's one of them!

615
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:57,123
This guy's infected!

616
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,720
His eyes! Look at his eyes!

617
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,412
He'll become one of them!

618
01:16:02,419 --> 01:16:04,120
Do you all want to die?!

619
01:16:04,121 --> 01:16:05,654
We must throw them out!

620
01:16:16,508 --> 01:16:19,848
Those of you who just arrived,

621
01:16:20,304 --> 01:16:23,914
I don't think you can stay with us.

622
01:16:24,556 --> 01:16:27,484
Please move to the vestibule.

623
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:42,807
Just go!

624
01:16:46,996 --> 01:16:49,385
Get out!

625
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:57,045
Get out now!

626
01:16:58,937 --> 01:17:00,348
Hurry up!

627
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:02,225
Move!

628
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,386
Go!

629
01:17:06,183 --> 01:17:07,576
Leave us!

630
01:17:08,961 --> 01:17:10,536
Get the hell out!

631
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:12,727
Out now!

632
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:15,671
Hurry!

633
01:17:19,412 --> 01:17:23,305
It'll be safer for you to stay here.

634
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:26,762
No, I don't want to stay.

635
01:17:26,763 --> 01:17:28,005
I'm coming with you.

636
01:17:28,006 --> 01:17:29,209
But...

637
01:17:29,234 --> 01:17:30,546
Get the hell out!

638
01:17:31,115 --> 01:17:33,433
What are you waiting for!

639
01:17:33,744 --> 01:17:35,371
Okay, let's go.

640
01:17:37,684 --> 01:17:40,577
Get out! Rest of you!

641
01:17:40,658 --> 01:17:41,996
Get out!

642
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,222
Get out of here!

643
01:18:02,134 --> 01:18:03,198
Let's go.

644
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:42,149
Tie it faster!

645
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:44,381
More ties! Neckties!

646
01:18:44,382 --> 01:18:46,975
Shut up! I'm working on it!

647
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:03,541
Yun In-gil

648
01:19:04,716 --> 01:19:05,910
Great name.

649
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:12,070
Always helping others instead of yourself.

650
01:19:15,607 --> 01:19:18,500
Why did you live like that?

651
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:22,579
What was the point?

652
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,886
So stupid...

653
01:19:31,463 --> 01:19:33,351
Shut up! Be quiet!

654
01:19:34,193 --> 01:19:36,109
Stay in your seat!

655
01:19:36,584 --> 01:19:40,392
What a load of shit.

656
01:19:43,818 --> 01:19:46,561
Finish up and do the other side too.

657
01:19:59,112 --> 01:20:01,695
Thank you for everything.

658
01:20:02,655 --> 01:20:03,407
That woman...

659
01:20:03,619 --> 01:20:05,133
Stop her!

660
01:20:59,053 --> 01:21:01,656
Control, this is Busan-bound 101!

661
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:04,590
Requesting current situation in Busan, over.

662
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:06,533
Control!

663
01:21:07,108 --> 01:21:08,108
Control!

664
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:37,127
It's your birthday...

665
01:22:41,186 --> 01:22:42,414
Don't worry.

666
01:22:43,086 --> 01:22:45,486
I'll take you to mom no matter what.

667
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,560
Aren't you scared?

668
01:22:56,868 --> 01:22:57,894
Of course I am.

669
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:01,694
I'm scared too.

670
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:08,768
I was so scared.

671
01:23:09,082 --> 01:23:12,441
I thought I'd never see you again.

672
01:23:14,211 --> 01:23:20,033
I practiced that song just for you.

673
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:25,815
That's why I couldn't sing.

674
01:23:27,945 --> 01:23:29,900
Because I didn't see you.

675
01:23:37,268 --> 01:23:39,743
Will you stay with me?

676
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:56,465
Ex-wife

677
01:24:07,589 --> 01:24:12,829
The person you're calling is not available...

678
01:24:22,338 --> 01:24:23,775
Analyst Kim

679
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:29,631
Yes, Kim.

680
01:24:31,283 --> 01:24:33,316
Have you arrived in Busan?

681
01:24:33,317 --> 01:24:36,139
Not yet, where are you?
Is it okay there?

682
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:40,280
Busan succeeded in initial defense.

683
01:24:40,696 --> 01:24:41,829
What?

684
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,733
You sure?

685
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:45,719
Where did you hear this from?

686
01:24:46,321 --> 01:24:50,627
Chief, we are the one who started this.

687
01:24:52,931 --> 01:24:56,983
Our plant started all of this.

688
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:06,649
Chief, please tell me it's not our fault.

689
01:25:07,573 --> 01:25:11,357
We're only doing our jobs right?

690
01:25:11,713 --> 01:25:14,570
Is this my fault?

691
01:25:17,548 --> 01:25:18,548
It's...

692
01:25:19,731 --> 01:25:21,064
It's not your fault.

693
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:26,103
Thank you...

694
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:29,394
Kim...

695
01:27:14,644 --> 01:27:16,769
Attention please.

696
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:21,000
Due to a blockage on our track,

697
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:23,547
we have stopped at East Daegu Station.

698
01:27:23,548 --> 01:27:27,264
We should either wait for the rescue team,

699
01:27:27,265 --> 01:27:32,398
or we'll have to reach Busan in another train.

700
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:35,048
As soon as I end this announcement,

701
01:27:35,049 --> 01:27:40,351
I will find a working train
and put it on left most track.

702
01:27:40,352 --> 01:27:44,454
-What's going on?
-I repeat, left most track.

703
01:27:44,455 --> 01:27:49,885
If you're alive, please transfer safely.

704
01:27:51,175 --> 01:27:52,462
Godspeed.

705
01:28:58,257 --> 01:29:00,095
Will there be a rescue?

706
01:29:02,621 --> 01:29:04,897
I heard that Busan is safe.

707
01:29:07,354 --> 01:29:08,687
We have to move now.

708
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,209
Coast clear?

709
01:30:58,275 --> 01:30:59,275
Yeah.

710
01:31:02,298 --> 01:31:04,022
You go ahead.

711
01:31:27,889 --> 01:31:30,022
We've got to find a way across.

712
01:31:53,903 --> 01:31:54,903
What in the...

713
01:32:07,309 --> 01:32:08,309
Over here!

714
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:46,599
No...

715
01:32:46,722 --> 01:32:47,722
Oh no...

716
01:32:50,202 --> 01:32:51,202
What now...

717
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:54,155
We have to move, come on!

718
01:33:02,596 --> 01:33:04,235
Jin-hee, let's go!

719
01:33:20,523 --> 01:33:21,554
Stand back!

720
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,600
Jin-hee!

721
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,125
Jin-hee!

722
01:34:03,005 --> 01:34:04,366
This can't be...

723
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:11,451
I'm sorry...

724
01:34:34,822 --> 01:34:44,961
Daddy! Wake up!

725
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:49,075
Daddy! Daddy!

726
01:35:05,296 --> 01:35:07,228
What's going on?

727
01:35:10,817 --> 01:35:12,383
Come on faster! Faster!

728
01:35:20,542 --> 01:35:21,752
Dammit!

729
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,240
Help!

730
01:36:22,594 --> 01:36:23,860
Sweetie, come here!

731
01:36:28,624 --> 01:36:30,144
Su-an, Su-an!

732
01:36:46,855 --> 01:36:47,855
Mister!

733
01:37:06,478 --> 01:37:07,478
Sweetie!

734
01:37:07,579 --> 01:37:09,382
Su-an, come here!

735
01:37:10,097 --> 01:37:10,652
Mister...

736
01:37:10,777 --> 01:37:12,334
Go! Hurry!

737
01:37:13,528 --> 01:37:14,528
Come on!

738
01:37:14,777 --> 01:37:15,777
Hurry!

739
01:37:38,233 --> 01:37:39,233
Let's go!

740
01:39:03,090 --> 01:39:04,090
Hurry! Hurry!

741
01:39:07,543 --> 01:39:08,543
Daddy!

742
01:41:30,393 --> 01:41:31,393
Mister.

743
01:41:33,423 --> 01:41:34,668
Please bring me to Busan.

744
01:41:39,774 --> 01:41:41,774
Please help me.

745
01:41:42,405 --> 01:41:45,171
My mother is waiting for me.

746
01:41:48,773 --> 01:41:54,851
Please bring me home…

747
01:41:58,268 --> 01:42:00,467
Please save me.

748
01:42:03,732 --> 01:42:07,736
You are already infected.

749
01:42:18,384 --> 01:42:25,245
No, no, no, no...

750
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:54,551
Su-an come here. Sit here.

751
01:44:57,640 --> 01:44:59,381
Listen to me...

752
01:45:00,255 --> 01:45:04,334
Here is the throttle, the brakes.

753
01:45:05,268 --> 01:45:08,762
When you need to stop, pull the breaks.

754
01:45:13,462 --> 01:45:14,462
Su-an.

755
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:25,197
Look at me...

756
01:45:26,398 --> 01:45:27,289
Su-an...

757
01:45:27,608 --> 01:45:29,024
Listen to me.

758
01:45:30,367 --> 01:45:34,028
You must stay with her, okay?

759
01:45:36,207 --> 01:45:39,960
Busan is still safe, that is why...
that is why...

760
01:45:39,961 --> 01:45:41,570
Don't go!

761
01:45:42,162 --> 01:45:45,115
Don't go father!
Come with us.

762
01:45:45,538 --> 01:45:47,176
Please don't leave me...

763
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,368
Don't go...

764
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:56,029
Don't go...

765
01:45:57,399 --> 01:45:59,982
You should come with us.

766
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:02,075
Don't go...

767
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,649
Don't go...

768
01:46:07,633 --> 01:46:09,253
Don't go...

769
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:13,840
Please come with us.
Don't go...

770
01:46:17,988 --> 01:46:21,588
Don't go...

771
01:46:23,356 --> 01:46:27,082
Father! Father!

772
01:46:33,263 --> 01:46:38,292
Father!
No! Don't go!

773
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:32,699
I see something.

774
01:51:41,667 --> 01:51:47,440
2 subjects approaching at our location.
Looks like a woman and a child.

775
01:51:48,462 --> 01:51:50,856
Are you able to verify the subjects?

776
01:51:54,029 --> 01:51:56,930
It's so dark on the other side.

777
01:52:01,486 --> 01:52:03,486
I can't clearly see them.

778
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:09,750
Can't clearly see the subjects, unable to verify.

779
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:13,526
Kill them.

780
01:53:02,828 --> 01:53:05,558
2 survivors approaching.
