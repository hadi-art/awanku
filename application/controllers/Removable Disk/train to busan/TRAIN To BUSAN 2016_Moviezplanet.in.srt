00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:37,069
What is it now this early?
You're going to bury my livestock again?

3
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,069
No, Its just a normal inspection,
there's just a small leak at the site.

4
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,069
Go ahead, move along.

5
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:54,069
Why are you doing this to me?
Just like the last time?

6
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:00,068
I promise, not this time, now move along.

7
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,069
Go

8
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:14,069
What a really bad day, rough morning, what more...

9
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,069
(RING RINGING)

10
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,069
Come on

11
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:23,069
Ehhhh

12
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,069
Oh come on

13
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,069
What a really rough day for me

14
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:40,180
TRAIN TO TUTUBAN

15
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,131
Madame,

16
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,569
Statistical data companies we showed abnormal in
stock market.

17
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,569
Please do not take your investment now.

18
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,569
the market will fall once you've taken your investment.

19
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,069
Yes, I understand.

20
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,069
Thank you for your consideration.

21
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,769
No, it is not. I will do it as soon as possible.

22
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,169
Yes.

23
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,169
It will be run according to your wishes.

24
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,969
Please take care!

25
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,169
Come into my office.

26
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,069
What is the matter?

27
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,769
Sell all of our assets in the stock market.

28
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,469
Selling it all?

29
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:51,469
Yes

30
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,969
Isn't it too risky to do that?

31
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,369
Still we could maintain our first asset.

32
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:57,969
And wait if something better ...

33
00:04:58,619 --> 00:04:59,269
Mr. Kim...

34
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:00,769
Yes.

35
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,069
Just do what I tell you to do.

36
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:07,069
We must be watchful of the possibility that happen.

37
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,069
Okay..

38
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,269
Wait a minute Mr.Kim...

39
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,269
What's the popular gift for kids nowadays?

40
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,068
Forget it. You really can't be a good dad to Su-an.
You didn't even attend her recital.

41
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,068
I did not forget that. There's a lot of work here.

42
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:34,068
She can stay here in Seoul with me.

43
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,969
Just send her here in Busan!

44
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,969
You've already broke your promises!

45
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,969
How many times have you tell her you'll come.

46
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:43,969
Can you keep it just this once?

47
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:45,969
Yes I promise we all go.

48
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:48,969
You really don't keep your words.

49
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:50,969
I'm keeping my words..

50
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:52,869
You just have to keep your words.

51
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,269
Children are tired of always with the promise-promise ...

52
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:55,969
Never mind, I'll talk to you ...

53
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,569
You know that its her birthday tomorrow right?

54
00:05:59,469 --> 00:05:59,969
I know!.

55
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:29,969
Oh, you're here now.

56
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:31,569
Thank you...

57
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:32,769
Where is she?

58
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:36,669
She was playing in her room ...

59
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,669
when will we see each other?

60
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,669
Why? Mom did not talk to dad huh?

61
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:51,069
-Im gonna hang the phone now, he's here.

62
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:06,069
It's okay you can talk to her.

63
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:08,069
-I already hung-up.

64
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:34,069
Here

65
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:42,069
You thought I forgot?
Happy birthday.

66
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:44,069
why, open it.

67
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:04,069
Why, you don't like it?

68
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:20,069
-Last year on children's day too.

69
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:30,069
Well, tell me what you want.

70
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:32,069
-Busan

71
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:36,069
-I want to go to mom at Busan.

72
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:36,369
tomorrow...

73
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:39,369
Yeah, just wait

74
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,369
We definitely there after affair
father finished ...

75
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:42,569
No...

76
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:43,869
Tomorrow...

77
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:46,469
Dad always say we'll go next time.

78
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:47,869
Anyway, tomorrow we have to go ...

79
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,969
You don't have to come with me.

80
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:53,569
grant my wish for once ...

81
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:02,769
Is there a lot of work?

82
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:04,569
Yes there is.

83
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,969
Are you going to Busan tomorrow?

84
00:09:08,469 --> 00:09:10,969
Yes.

85
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,969
You did good.
Try talking with your wife when you arrive there.

86
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:21,969
It's not good if you just break-up like that.

87
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:23,969
You two should re-unite again.

88
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:28,969
There is nothing wrong you are together again ...

89
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:33,369
Try it this time so that you can come back again ...

90
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:34,769
Mother...

91
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:36,969
I do not want to talk about it ...

92
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,969
Let it be the past ...

93
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:44,969
OK...

94
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,969
Do not be too busy with work ...

95
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,969
Sometimes you should not always focus on work.
Su-an is growing up.

96
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:54,969
She also needs you.

97
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:58,969
Take care of your family, especially Su-an.

98
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,969
It's okay.

99
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,969
It's okay, continue singing...

100
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,969
Applause for Soo-an ...

101
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,969
Yeah ... ma ..

102
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,269
No...

103
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:12,669
I'm with Dad.

104
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:17,669
Yeah, I'll see you there ...

105
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:37,069
You thought Father did not
know that you didn't finished the song.

106
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:41,069
how did you know? you weren't there.

107
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,069
Father always know what you've been doing

108
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:51,069
You got nervous right? Am I right?

109
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,068
Yes.

110
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:58,068
Why did you do that?
You'll look like a fool if you don't finish it.

111
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,068
When you started something.

112
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:02,069
You should finish it no matter what.

113
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:04,069
You should know that...........

114
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,069
Ahh.. That was close.

115
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:25,069
Whats going on?

116
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:34,069
Su-an, are you okay? You're surprised right?

117
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:37,069
It surprised me. It suddenly came out.

118
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,069
It looks like a big fire.

119
00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:01,069
(CENTRAL STATION)

120
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:13,069

121
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,068
Excuse me, where is the south station?

122
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,068
-Ah, South station, you need to that way..

123
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:18,069

00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,169
-Eat this.
-No, I don't like.

-Chief, Are you already on board?

You'll end up like him.

00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:15,069
My mother told me not to say that kind of words.

In a hurry?

172

We'll, you'll need to find another place
because it will take a while.

173
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:06,069
You could use the other comfort room.
Go there.

we're currently experiencing violent riots in all major cities,

304
00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:12,069
resulting in many civilian and police injuries.

305
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:17,069
Riots led to shutting down of various districts,

306
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:22,069
and the rioters have forcibly attempted to destroy

307
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:25,069
or take government property

308
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:30,069
For this reason, we're entering state of emergency,

Fellow citizens,

313

please refrain from reacting to baseless rumors,

314
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:04,069
and stay in the safety of your homes, (KEY WORD: ZOMBIES)

315
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:07,069
We must stay calm and trust the government,

00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:11,069
in order to overcome such trying obstacle.

317
00:33:12,069 --> 00:33:16,069

-We both got seats. -Keep walking.

334
00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:37,069
Su-an, you didn't have to do that.

335
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:40,069
-Do what? -Being good.

336
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:44,069
At a time like this, only watch out for yourself.

337
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:48,069
Answer me.

338
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:56,069
Granny always had knee aches.

339
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:59,069
Sweetie...

340
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,069
May i have you attention please

341
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:11,069
our train will conclude service at Daejeon station

342
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:17,069
Military is deployed there, and will secure our train,

343
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:21,069
so once we arrive, please exit the train.

344
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:23,069
I repeat,

345
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:27,069
DAEJEON STATION is our last stop.

346
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:29,069
Which cities can be entered?

347
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:32,069
Yeosu, Uljin, Busan. What about Daejeon?

348
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:34,069
Excuse me, I need to use it.

349
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:36,069
What about Daejeon?

350
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:38,069
Why not?!

351
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:41,099
Sweetie, stay put.

352
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:46,099
Hey, kiddo.

353
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:47,099
-Yes?

354
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:50,069
Who is he? Your dad?

355
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:52,069
-Yes

356
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,069
Real dad? -Yes.

357
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,069
I wanna know.

358
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:58,069
What does he do?

359
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:00,069
-He's a fund manager.

360
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:02,069
Fund manager? -Yes

361
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:04,069
He's a bloodsucker.

362
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:08,069
He leaches off others.

363
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:11,069
-Don't say that in front of his child.

364
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,069
It's okay

365
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:16,069
That's what everyone thinks,

366
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:23,069
-Want some?

367
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:26,069
-It's what Sleepy eats.

368
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,069
-This is Sleepy. Say hello.

369
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:33,069
Baby's name is Sleepy?

370
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:35,069
-No, the fetus name.

371
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,069
-It's like a nickname,

372
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:42,069
-He's daddy too lazy to come up with a name yet.

373
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,069
Touch her belly.

374
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,069
-Right here.

375
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,069
-Go on.

376
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,069
-Felt it?

377
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:59,069
I made that.

378
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:06,069
-You idiot... -But it's true, No?

379
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:09,069
(Analyst Kim)

380
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,069
Mr. Suh, you called me at a bad time.

381
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:22,069
Wait, Wait!

382
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:24,069
Let me ask you something,

383
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:26,069
What?

384
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:28,069
I'm on KTX to Daejeon.

385
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:32,069
KTX? Right this minute?

386
00:37:33,069 --> 00:37:34,069
Yes, I'm almost there,

387
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:38,069
Is it true military is deployed in Daejeon?

388
00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:40,069
Yes, that's correct.

389
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:46,069
Is that so? It must be safe there.

390
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:50,069
Well...It's...

391
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:54,069
Min, It is safe, right?

392
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:59,069
Once you arrive, you'll be quarantined.

393
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,069
What?

394
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:08,069
I'm with my daughter.

395
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:12,069
Can you help me and my daughter?

396
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:14,069
But the thing is...

397
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:18,069
I'll get you a real scoop, do me a favor.

398
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:24,069
Don't go to the main square, come to the East one.

399
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,069
I'll let my men know.

400
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:30,069
Okay, thank you. Thanks so much.

401
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:42,069
All dead... All dead...

402
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:57,069
What's going on?

403
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,069
So quiet.

404
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:01,069
Is it Daejeon?

405
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:06,069
There's nobody.

406
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:11,069
Why isn't anyone here?

407
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:22,069
What's going on back there?

408
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:28,069
This is that violent incident i told you about.

409
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:30,069
-Your'e the conductor?  -Yes.

410
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:33,069
How many can fit in the engine car?

411
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:35,069
We must uncouple it and go to Busan.

412
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,069
-Uncouple? -Yes!

413
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,069
-We can't! -Why not?!

414
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:41,069
It can't be done here.

415
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:43,069
Then, where's the Military?

416
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,069
Right...

417
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,069
I only recieved a report about it...

418
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:50,069
-Where's my business card...

419
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:53,069
-I'm COO of Stallion Express,

420
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:55,069
-all routes into Daejeon are cut off.

421
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:57,069
-our busses are all rerouted

422
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:58,099
But what for?

423
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:01,069
The City's been quarantined!

424
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:03,069
They probably won't let us in.

425
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:07,069
But Busan is still open, let's go there!

426
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:10,069
-Wait, if that's true...

427
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,069
-We just take others.  -Take Who?!

428
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:14,069
-Let's check the station first.

429
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:17,069
Hey!

430
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:21,069
Dammit!

431
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:45,069
<b>RESTRICTED AREA<b>

432
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:05,069
Don't mind them

433
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:12,069
Come on sweetie.

434
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:14,069
Where are we going?

435
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:17,069
We're going this way.

436
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,069
-Just us? -Yes, Let's go.

437
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:27,069
What is it?

438
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:30,069
I'm going this way too.

439
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:33,069
Main square is that way, just follow other people.

440
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:35,865
I'm gonna come with you.

441
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:38,485
I heard your phone call.

442
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:40,983
About pulling you two out.

443
00:42:42,942 --> 00:42:45,209
I know others will be quarantined.

444
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:48,618
It's not true, Su-an.

445
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:50,776
I'll go tell the others.

446
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:54,344
- You don't have to. - Of course I do!

447
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:56,704
Forget them! We're all on our own!

448
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:02,082
You only care about yourself.

449
00:43:04,806 --> 00:43:08,027
That's why mommy left.

450
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:28,699
Sweetie...

451
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,317
Here! Over here!

452
00:43:33,624 --> 00:43:34,624
Please help!

453
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:39,146
Sweetie, stay right here.

454
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,540
Goddamit!

455
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
Hold on!

456
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:17,301
Go back up! Go! Go!

457
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,005
Mr. Min

458
00:44:36,438 --> 00:44:37,878
<i>- Mr. Suh!</i> - I'm in Daejeon

459
00:44:37,879 --> 00:44:38,237

<i>- Mr. Suh!</i> - I'm in Daejeon

<i>Is everything okay there?
I can't contact my men!</i>

461
00:44:40,354 --> 00:44:41,145
What?
<i>Is everything okay there?
I can't contact my men!</i>

462
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:41,334
What?

463
00:44:41,543 --> 00:44:42,543
Hello?

464
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:44,091

- Over here! Run! - This way! Hurry!

473
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:03,002
Here!

474

This way!

475
00:47:08,582 --> 00:47:09,582
Come on!

476
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,025
Hurry!

477
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:11,117
Why aren't we leaving yet?!
Hurry!

478
00:47:11,118 --> 00:47:12,826
Why aren't we leaving yet?!

479
00:47:13,766 --> 00:47:15,633
There are still more people!

480
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:17,019
Hurry up!

481
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:18,699
Come this way!

482
00:47:20,444 --> 00:47:21,444
Hurry!

483

Faster! Here!

484
00:47:36,685 --> 00:47:37,685
Granny!

485
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,520
Please get up!

486
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,260
No, stop!

487
00:47:51,894 --> 00:47:52,894
My sister!

488
00:48:01,566 --> 00:48:02,566
Hop on!

489
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,050
Me too!

490
00:48:24,784 --> 00:48:25,784
Let me in!

491
00:48:26,745 --> 00:48:27,745
Please!

492
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:47,814
How much longer? We have to leave!

493
00:48:48,222 --> 00:48:50,289
No! my friends aren't here yet!

494
00:48:51,156 --> 00:48:53,409
Those onboard must survive!

495
00:48:54,145 --> 00:48:55,145
Ain't I right?

496
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Conductor.

497
00:49:04,145 --> 00:49:06,145
Please...depart.

498
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:29,057
Run! let's go!

499
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:45,345
Look, the train!

500
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:46,773
Run faster!

501
00:50:06,365 --> 00:50:07,832
Snap out of it, idiot!

502
00:50:37,175 --> 00:50:38,175
Watch out!

503
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:04,276
Control, 101 could not dock
at Daejeon due to outbreak.

504
00:51:04,556 --> 00:51:07,515
Advise which station is
available to dock, over.

505
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:12,766
101, due to unstable comm,
it is difficult to advise.

506
00:51:13,118 --> 00:51:17,921
Control, is 101 clear to reach Busan? Over.

507
00:51:20,973 --> 00:51:24,223
101, we'll clear your route to Busan.

508
00:51:24,224 --> 00:51:24,243
Control center, out.
101, we'll clear your route to Busan.

509
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:25,224
Control center, out.

510
00:51:26,512 --> 00:51:29,179
Advise when you make contact with Busan.

511
00:51:30,036 --> 00:51:31,036
101, out.

512
00:52:47,504 --> 00:52:49,004
Attention everyone.

513
00:52:50,131 --> 00:52:55,206
For those safety of those on board,
we won't be making any stops,

514
00:52:55,387 --> 00:52:57,254
and head straight for Busan.

515
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:00,441
Conductor, can you hear me?

516
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:02,126
Go ahead.

517
00:53:02,705 --> 00:53:04,772
Were you able to contact Busan?

518
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,086
No, the communication is erratic.

519
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:11,236
Full speed, no matter what!

520
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:13,858
Or we won't get in, understand?

521
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,732
Young-guk, where are you?

522
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:28,829
I thought you were dead!

523
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:30,527
I'm sorry!

524
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,417
No one else made it!

525
00:53:36,444 --> 00:53:37,563
I'm sorry.

526
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:49,900
- Baby? - Mister!

527
00:53:51,913 --> 00:53:54,647
Huh? Why are you answering? Where are you?

528
00:53:54,644 --> 00:53:56,572
We're in the train washroom!

529
00:53:56,707 --> 00:53:59,707
Washroom? which car?

530
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:02,398
Well... it's...

531
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
Car 13!

532
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,393
- Get your ass over here! - Baby

533
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,924
Was that my kid? Is she okay?

534
00:54:12,846 --> 00:54:14,113
Washroom in car 13.

535
00:54:28,904 --> 00:54:30,152
Gonna pass through?

536
00:54:32,582 --> 00:54:34,924
Let's say you got through and rescue them,

537
00:54:34,925 --> 00:54:35,381
how will you come back?
Let's say you got through and rescue them,

538
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:36,458
how will you come back?

539
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:42,423
In car 15,

540
00:54:44,399 --> 00:54:46,132
people are gathered there.

541
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:53,423
<i>Car 9</i>

542
00:55:11,176 --> 00:55:12,310
Only 4 cars away.

543
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:15,809
I'll lead,

544
00:55:17,686 --> 00:55:18,886
you in the middle,

545
00:55:20,536 --> 00:55:21,869
and you in the back.

546
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:27,124
Block anyone attacking from the rear.

547
00:55:37,095 --> 00:55:40,850
I heard you're a fund manager.

548
00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:45,466
Then you're an expert,

549
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:49,223
at leaving useless people behind.

550
00:55:55,883 --> 00:55:57,816
Wait till we exit the tunnel.

551
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,580
Let's go.

552
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,470
Come on!

553
00:57:28,593 --> 00:57:29,593
Let's go!

554
00:57:46,036 --> 00:57:47,036
Move.

555
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:32,314
Out of the way.

556
00:59:36,278 --> 00:59:39,411
They stopped once we
entered the tunnel, right?

557
00:59:40,713 --> 00:59:42,392
Probably because of darkness.

558
00:59:42,393 --> 00:59:42,645
Yeah, I think so too.
Probably because of darkness.

559
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:43,793
Yeah, I think so too.

560
00:59:47,225 --> 00:59:48,892
There are even more here.

561
00:59:50,123 --> 00:59:51,323
What do we do now?

562
00:59:52,165 --> 00:59:53,832
There's no way around it.

563
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:56,099
Let's go.

564
00:59:56,123 --> 00:59:58,123
NO SUBS FOR 2 Minutes

565
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:06,809
SUBS AVAILABLE NOW

566
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:08,434
Get that out of my face.

567
01:02:10,255 --> 01:02:11,255
Yo, douche.

568
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,890
Felt good to see your kid thanks to me?

569
01:02:17,328 --> 01:02:19,019
Are you grateful or what?

570
01:02:19,955 --> 01:02:21,955
Why is your ringtone so tacky?

571
01:02:23,295 --> 01:02:24,695
What's wrong with it?

572
01:02:27,115 --> 01:02:28,382
How do i change it?

573
01:02:30,491 --> 01:02:34,468
Am i funny? You little rat?

574
01:02:35,744 --> 01:02:36,878
How tall are you?

575
01:02:37,151 --> 01:02:38,151
181cm.

576
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:41,492
10km away, at 300km/h...

577
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:42,965
What?

578
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,221
2 minutes, upcoming tunnel
will give us 2 minutes.

579
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:51,302
- Can we do it? - We gotta.

580
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:57,311
If we miss this one,
there's another in 3km...

581
01:02:57,312 --> 01:03:00,834
I bet you never get to
play with your daughter.

582
01:03:03,345 --> 01:03:04,678
When she gets older,

583
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:09,167
she'll understand why you work so hard.

584
01:03:11,673 --> 01:03:14,502
Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,

585
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:17,705
but it's all about sacrifice, right?

586
01:03:21,144 --> 01:03:24,356
What's with the look? Did I sound cool?

587
01:03:33,569 --> 01:03:35,769
<i>People rescued. Heading over now.</i>

588
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,620
My friend's coming here!

589
01:03:39,411 --> 01:03:40,287
What did you say?

590
01:03:40,288 --> 01:03:40,410
My friend from another car is coming over.
What did you say?

591
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:43,088
My friend from another car is coming over.

592
01:03:43,661 --> 01:03:45,528
- Who's coming? - My friend!

593
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:49,453
He was in car 9, and he
rescued some people.

594
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:50,931
Rescued?

595
01:03:52,825 --> 01:03:57,167
From there to here, passing
through those monsters?

596
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,484
Without any injuries?

597
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,338
You sure they're not infected?

598
01:04:04,143 --> 01:04:06,620
Are you damn sure?!

599
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,603
What do you mean?

600
01:04:10,032 --> 01:04:12,848
Look, look at them.

601
01:04:13,847 --> 01:04:15,314
At a moment like this,

602
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:19,905
no one knows what happened
to their families.

603
01:04:20,912 --> 01:04:25,441
We don't even know if your
damn friends are infected!

604
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:28,563
But allow them in here?!

605
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:34,984
I don't believe this.

606
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:45,451
Sir,

607
01:04:47,308 --> 01:04:50,149
please say something.

608
01:04:51,232 --> 01:04:52,632
They'll be here soon.

609
01:04:55,162 --> 01:04:56,162
Sir!

610
01:08:44,895 --> 01:08:45,895
Get over here.

611
01:08:54,946 --> 01:08:55,946
One!

612
01:08:58,296 --> 01:08:59,296
Two!

613
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,350
Run!

614
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:21,656
Jin-hee! Jin-hee!

615
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,200
Hurry the hell up!

616
01:09:36,017 --> 01:09:37,017
Open up!

617
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:40,931
Hey! Open this door!

618
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:44,013
Jin-hee!

619
01:09:44,109 --> 01:09:45,109
Open this door!

620
01:10:01,292 --> 01:10:04,022
- Open up! - Jin-hee, Jin-hee

621
01:10:14,294 --> 01:10:16,042
Open it now!

622
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:18,179
It wont budge!

623
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:19,447
It can't open it!

624
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:20,719
Smash it!

625
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:22,801
Stand back!

626
01:10:29,423 --> 01:10:30,423
Hurry up!

627
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:36,435
Dammit...

628
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:02,291
You stupid idiots!

629
01:11:15,969 --> 01:11:16,969
Come on!

630
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:29,479
In-gil!

631
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:36,441
Young-guk!

632
01:11:40,155 --> 01:11:41,140
Stand back!

633
01:11:41,141 --> 01:11:41,154
Young-guk!
Stand back!

634
01:11:41,155 --> 01:11:42,141
Young-guk!

635
01:12:16,925 --> 01:12:17,925
Stay away!

636
01:12:24,879 --> 01:12:28,726
Stay back, baby. Please go!

637
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:36,719
Buddy, hey!

638
01:12:37,849 --> 01:12:40,091
Take her and leave.

639
01:12:41,118 --> 01:12:42,891
You have to go!

640
01:12:44,631 --> 01:12:45,831
I said go, douche!

641
01:12:47,983 --> 01:12:49,916
I'm getting tired, please go.

642
01:12:53,312 --> 01:12:56,713
Take care of her, okay?

643
01:12:58,638 --> 01:13:01,698
I'll hold them off, just go!

644
01:13:11,698 --> 01:13:14,198
I'm sorry...

645
01:13:25,064 --> 01:13:27,064
We have to go, let's go!

646
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:30,079
Yoon Su-yun!

647
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,747
Our baby's name!

648
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:36,789
Got it?

649
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:38,276
Why did you do it?!

650
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:41,880
You bastard!

651
01:15:44,018 --> 01:15:45,485
We could've save them!

652
01:15:48,184 --> 01:15:49,184
Why?!

653
01:15:50,356 --> 01:15:51,356
He's infected!

654
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:54,965
He's one of them!

655
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:57,163
This guy's infected!

656
01:15:57,672 --> 01:15:59,472
His eyes! Look at his eyes!

657
01:16:00,077 --> 01:16:01,744
He'll become one of them!

658
01:16:02,262 --> 01:16:03,862
Do you all want to die?!

659
01:16:04,246 --> 01:16:05,779
We must throw them out!

660
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:19,349
Those of you who just arrived,

661
01:16:20,361 --> 01:16:22,694
I don't think you can stay with us.

662
01:16:24,787 --> 01:16:26,720
Please move to the vestibule.

663
01:16:41,866 --> 01:16:42,866
Just go!

664
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:48,690
Get out!

665
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,300
Get out now!

666
01:16:58,915 --> 01:16:59,915
Hurry up!

667
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:02,290
Move!

668
01:17:04,074 --> 01:17:05,074
Go!

669
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:06,470
Leave us!

670
01:17:08,634 --> 01:17:09,767
Get the hell out!

671
01:17:11,767 --> 01:17:12,767
Out now!

672
01:17:14,572 --> 01:17:15,572
Hurry!

673
01:17:19,724 --> 01:17:22,224
It'll be safer for you to stay here.

674
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:25,280
No, I don't want to stay.

675
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:28,030
I'm coming with you.

676
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:29,135
But...

677
01:17:29,474 --> 01:17:30,607
Get the hell out!

678
01:17:31,332 --> 01:17:32,998
What are you waiting for!

679
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:35,011
Okay, let's go.

680
01:17:37,951 --> 01:17:39,915
Get out! Rest of you!

681
01:17:40,747 --> 01:17:41,747
Get out!

682
01:17:42,475 --> 01:17:43,541
Get out of here!

683
01:18:02,272 --> 01:18:03,272
Let's go.

684
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:41,982
Tie it faster!

685
01:18:43,426 --> 01:18:44,529
More ties! Neckties!

686
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:44,758
Shut up! I'm working on it!
More ties! Neckties!

687
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:46,330
Shut up! I'm working on it!

688
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:04,114
Yun In-gil

689
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:05,941
Great name.

690
01:19:07,754 --> 01:19:11,399
Always helping others instead of yourself.

691
01:19:15,247 --> 01:19:17,596
Why did you live like that?

692
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,560
What was the point?

693
01:19:22,919 --> 01:19:23,919
So stupid...

694
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:32,980
Shut up! Be quiet!

695
01:19:34,332 --> 01:19:35,532
Stay in your seat!

696
01:19:36,752 --> 01:19:38,752
What a load of shit.

697
01:19:43,844 --> 01:19:46,244
Finish up and do the other side too.

698
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:01,115
Thank you for everyting.

699
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,634
That woman...

700
01:20:03,635 --> 01:20:03,679
Stop her!
That woman...

701
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,635
Stop her!

702
01:20:59,196 --> 01:21:01,696
Control, this is Busan-bound 101!

703
01:21:01,697 --> 01:21:04,630
Requesting current
situation in Busan, over.

704
01:21:05,446 --> 01:21:06,446
Control?!

705
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,196
Control!

706
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,536
It's your birthday...

707
01:22:41,226 --> 01:22:42,226
Don't worry.

708
01:22:43,342 --> 01:22:45,742
I'll take you to mom no matter what.

709
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:50,892
Aren't you scared?

710
01:22:56,908 --> 01:22:57,934
Of course I am.

711
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:01,222
I'm scared too.

712
01:23:06,385 --> 01:23:07,452
I was so scared.

713
01:23:09,348 --> 01:23:11,615
I thought I'd never see you again.

714
01:23:14,496 --> 01:23:18,741
I practiced that song just for you.

715
01:23:23,806 --> 01:23:25,606
That's why I couldn't sing.

716
01:23:28,162 --> 01:23:29,829
Because I didn't see you.

717
01:23:36,931 --> 01:23:39,406
Will you stay with me?

718
01:23:55,505 --> 01:23:56,505
Ex-wife

719
01:24:08,007 --> 01:24:11,223
The person you're calling is not available

720
01:24:22,815 --> 01:24:23,815
Analyst Kim

721
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:29,163
Yes, Kim.

722
01:24:31,637 --> 01:24:33,370
Have you arrived in Busan?

723
01:24:33,414 --> 01:24:36,147
Not yet, where are you? Is it okay there?

724
01:24:37,993 --> 01:24:40,326
Busan succeeded in initial defense.

725
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:42,250
What? You sure?

726
01:24:46,117 --> 01:24:47,249
Chief.

727
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,249
We are the one who started this.

728
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:56,250
Our plant started all of this.

729
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:02,250
Please tell me it's not our fault.

730
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:02,250
Chief.

731
01:25:08,117 --> 01:25:10,250
We're only doing our jobs right?

732
01:25:12,216 --> 01:25:13,716
<i>Is this my fault?</i>

733
01:25:17,874 --> 01:25:18,874
It's...

734
01:25:20,034 --> 01:25:21,367
It's not your fault.

735
01:25:25,261 --> 01:25:26,261
<i>Thank you...</i>

736
01:25:28,761 --> 01:25:29,761
Kim...

737
01:27:14,893 --> 01:27:16,026
<i>Attention please.</i>

738
01:27:17,113 --> 01:27:20,544
<i>Due to a blockage on our track,</i>

739
01:27:21,248 --> 01:27:23,278
<i>we have stopped at East Daegu Station.</i>

740
01:27:23,416 --> 01:27:26,916
<i>We should either wait for the rescue team,</i>

741
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:31,873
<i>or we'll have to reach
Busan in another train.</i>

742
01:27:33,063 --> 01:27:34,771
<i>As soon as I end this announcement,</i>

743
01:27:35,071 --> 01:27:40,660
<i>I will find a working train and
put it on left most track.</i>

744
01:27:40,924 --> 01:27:41,595
What's going on?

745
01:27:41,596 --> 01:27:41,990
<i>I repeat, left most track.</i>
What's going on?

746
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:43,945
<i>I repeat, left most track.</i>

747
01:27:44,542 --> 01:27:49,056
If you're alive, please transfer safely.

748
01:27:50,889 --> 01:27:51,889
Godspeed.

749
01:28:58,297 --> 01:28:59,830
Will there be a rescue?

750
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,776
I heard that Busan is safe.

751
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:08,963
We have to move now.

752
01:30:54,317 --> 01:30:55,317
Coast clear?

753
01:30:58,020 --> 01:30:59,020
Yeah.

754
01:31:02,338 --> 01:31:03,338
You go ahead.

755
01:31:28,129 --> 01:31:30,262
We've got to find a way across.

756
01:31:54,106 --> 01:31:55,106
What in the...

757
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:08,421
Over here!

758
01:32:45,631 --> 01:32:46,631
No...

759
01:32:46,777 --> 01:32:47,777
Oh no...

760
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:51,219
What now...

761
01:32:52,715 --> 01:32:54,382
We have to move, come on!

762
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:04,311

You must stay with her, okay?

805

Busan is still safe, that is why... that is why...

Approaching 2 subjects at our location.
Looks like a woman and a child.

Are you able to verify the subjects?

822
01:51:54,069 --> 01:51:56,069
Its so dark on the other side

823
01:52:01,069 --> 01:52:03,069
I can't clearly see them

824
01:52:05,069 --> 01:52:09,069
Cant clearly see the subjects, unable to verify.

825
01:52:11,069 --> 01:52:12,069
Kill them.
